# SkyLines

*SkyLines* is a web platform where pilots can share their flights with others
after, or even during flight via live tracking.  *SkyLines* is a sort of social
network for pilots including rankings, statistics and other interesting
features.  Most of all *SkyLines* is truly open in all regards compared to
other similar platforms.

*SkyLines* has started development in 2012 as a spin-off from the popular
[XCSoar](http://www.xcsoar.org/) glide computer. Internally *SkyLines* is still
sharing some code with XCSoar in the algorithmic areas and is providing the
base for XCSoar's live tracking functionalities.

*SkyLines* is far from finished yet, but it has been running in production for
quite some time now. You can reach the official server at
<http://www.skylines-project.org> or <http://www.skylines.aero>.

Build Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skylines-project/skylines.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skylines-project/skylines)

## Getting the source

The *SkyLines* source code is managed with [git](http://www.git-scm.com/).
It can be downloaded with the following command:

    $ git clone git://github.com/skylines-project/skylines.git

For more information, please refer to the [git documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation).

## Installation and Setup

*SkyLines* is based on Python and depends on the following major components:

* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database with
  [PostGIS 2.x](http://www.postgis.net/) extension
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web application microframework for Python
* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) ORM framework with
  [GeoAlchemy 2](https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.org) extension
* [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) networking engine for Python (used for
  the live tracking server)

The process of installing these components and setting up a server for local
development is described in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.

Bugs and feature request can be submitted either to the
[XCSoar trac](bugs.xcsoar.org) instance under the *SkyLines* milestone or on
[GitHub](https://github.com/skylines-project/skylines/issues). New ideas can
also be discussed in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/skylines-project/skylines/wiki) first.

Patches should be submitted using the
[Pull Request](https://github.com/skylines-project/skylines/pulls) system of
GitHub because of the integration with the
[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/skylines-project/skylines) system. You can
also send patches via mail to any of the [current maintainers](AUTHORS.md)
though.

Here are a few guidelines for creating patches:

- patches should be self-contained
- patches should be self-documenting (add a good description on what
  is changed, and why you are changing it)
- write one patch for one change
