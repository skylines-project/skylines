We prefer using the pull request system of Github due to the integration with
the TravisCI system, but you can also send patches via mail to any of the
current developers.

- patches should be self-contained
- patches should be self-documenting (add a good description on what
  is changed, and why you are changing it)
- write one patch for one change
