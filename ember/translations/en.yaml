  description: 'SkyLines Live Tracking can be used to let others take part on your journeys while you''re flying. It uses a very light-weight protocol that only transmits the necessary data and due to that it can also work in areas/altitudes where the reception isn''t very good. To give you an example: A flight of 10 hours only uses about 340 KB of traffic when the positions are transmitted every 5 seconds!'
